Antonio Conte considers defeat to be a virtual state of death. He was born in Lecce, in southern Italy, but spent thirteen years immersed in the uncompromising winning culture at Juventus, where an allergy to failure was driven deep into his being.

I've had an excellent response to the request for contributors from /r/ChelseaFC for this post, so if you're interested in writing a paragraph about your favourite player or a young player who people might not know much about, let me know a few days before your team comes up. Thanks to all who read and commented on the previous posts, I got some great feedback, there Okay so I own a 2012 Euro (FK2) Honda Civic. Today my girlfriend noticed the mat on the passenger side in the car was soaked. After removing the mat, it was quickly established that the carpet was wet too so the source of the water is coming from below the carpet.

Hey everyone, this is a long overdue topic I've been meaning to address as the number of "How do I best hook up my console to an HDTV?" threads keep increasing. This article tries to make no assumptions and makes it easy to learn about the XRGB Mini. I've spent a ton of time looking into things like compatibility issues and console specific "gotchas" and will try to take as much info as I've gathered into account when detailing my setup.
