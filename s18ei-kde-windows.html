I download the theme, apply it and only the launcher menu and panel backgrounds show the blurred translucent aspect. Windows always look plain solid on anything that ain't title bar. I've even find the setting to control the blur and noise of the effect, but it refuses to do its stuff. Amy ideas about Back in 2000-2007 this would’ve been an awesome product with a lot of interest. And from 2008-2011 there were still a lot of fans hoping for a better alternative to Windows 7, OS X, iOS, Windows.

Has anyone picked up that there has been a recent change in how maximised windows are treated? I noticed that since this weeks update to KDE Neon, suddenly any maximised windows would "cast a shadow" onto the next screen on a dual screen setup, which is definitely a new thing as my browser suddenly had black gradients on both sides. If I switch off the drop shadows, things go back to normal. I updated my KDE yesterday and I noticed something weird today (2019-01-10). I'm running KDE framework. KDE, rather than being only a desktop environment, is actually a collection of applications, one of which is the desktop environment itself.The latest iteration of KDE is called Plasma, which comes in two variations – Plasma Desktop and Plasma Netbook. Resizing windows in 18.3 KDE is very difficult as the border is like 1 pixel thick. The umbra, penumbra and antumbra are three distinct parts of a shadow, created by any light source after impinging on an opaque object. Assuming no diffraction, for a point source only the umbra Hey all, long time Linux user and I just installed KDE Neon. I'm loving it so far, but I have one issue. When I try and connect to my Windows shares on my other PC the authentication fails. I know the username and password are right because it works from all my other PCs. Can someone tell me if there is a package I need to install or configure to be able to connect to Windows shares in Dolphin. Hello. I would like to write a KDE window decoration using KDecoration2. I want to start from the Skeleton decoration: After compiling this example, the so file is installed to /usr/local/lib64/plugins/org.kde.kdecoration2/skeleton_decoration.so However the KDE systemsettings does not display any Skeleton decoration. I also changed the the prefix to /usr, without success. Where shall the decorations be installed? And one more question:. I'm talking about the themes you can choose from the window manager settings. Both of the default ones, Breeze and Plastik, work fine, but any of the ones I install have weird scaling issues and don't look good at all. Anybody 
Hi Screen capture of the problem: https://imgur.com/a/b3Roy Not sure if I should post this here or at /r/kde or as a bug report. Anyway, I moved from Windows 10 to Debian Stretch a few months ago. I have a lot of experience with Debian on servers but not on the desktop. I'm very happy with the upgrade to Debian and for the most part things work as I want. But one annoying thing is that after some time after last boot some windows and panels in KDE stops refreshing. Ex. I click Hello reddit, maybe I overlooked something in the settings, but my question is (see title): How can I make a KDE Window start at the centre position of my screen, and not at one of the edges? The location of a new Window seems really random to me. Thanks On a fresh install of Fedora 25, I'm having a ton of problems. I have a corsair keyboard, which doesn't play too well with linux in general, but manages to be ok on Ubuntu. On Fedora, I downloaded the open source drivers from github: https://github.com/mattanger/ckb-next Which works most of the times, but will never work when decrypting the drive. I have to plug in another keyboard just to enter the passphrase, and then I can log in normally. I already set ckb to work on start-up. -Is there any way to disable the mouse wheel (the wheel between the left-click and right-click buttons) from scrolling between items (loaded apps) when the mouse cursor hovers over the window list? -Is there any way to enable a drag and rearrange option for items in the window list? Also, is there a way to disable notifications from specific apps (like from Firefox or LibreOffice), without disabling all notifications? Assuming that the apps themseslves provide no such settings. Thanks. 
Under Compiz I just had to use the Windows Tilte" option and "contains" and enter a string such as "call with". With KDE I have to use either "Substring Match", but "call with", " Call with" or similar just don't work. The detect window properties option doesn't detect a Window Role for Skype, and I can't work out any way to get the main skype window and the skype call windows to act differently. Can anyone please advise how I can get the call window Using the 1504 beta2 live-cd, you can see how window placement rules are broken in latest KDE. View the screenshots ( Looks like window matching isn't working the same as before. Amazed this bug made it this late in a release cycle. I am running Mint 14 KDE 64 bit. I attempted to install libreoffice 4.0 via the ppa on launchpad, but had some strange issues I reported to the maintainer. I then installed via the DEBS available from the Libreoffice website with no installation problems. Unfortunately, it looks awful. The window themes (oxygen, plastik, etc) don't seem to have any effect on the Libreoffice window. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestion. It runs quite fast, but doesnt look as nice as it could. Plasma wayland session: + My Latte dock doesn't work correctly as usual. + The cursor becomes bigger when I hover it over the KDE windows.

Is there any plan to make new release?, or could I get more recent windows builds via another method. TL;DR: Does anybody know how to enable previews/thumbnails for video files in KDE under Windows, particularly in digiKam? I've been testing digiKam to manage my photo library for the past few days. I've been really liking it. There's only one thing I'm missing: video thumbnails. It shows photo thumbnails just fine, but for video files it doesn't, making it difficult to identify which video is which. I've been searching for a solution, but most of the info I find is for various Linux distros. I've just tries switching to kde from bdpwm, and have run into an issue where windows with KDE's window decorations are very laggy when dragged. Windows like chromium where decorations are turned off are fine. All other windows are very laggy when dragging. If the window decoration theme is set to plastik, then everything is fine. Oxygen and breeze are bad. Seemingly all downloaded themes are fine. What I mean by laggy: Kwin's fps droops to 4-10fps while dragging. This happens regardless Kubuntu is an operating system built by a worldwide community of developers, testers, supporters and translators. Kubuntu is a free, complete
