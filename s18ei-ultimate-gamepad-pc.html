Something something there are those who said something. I'll let /u/ske7ch343 to explain it --- #THE GREAT JOURNEY --- gtBefore we jump into what all this means, let’s take a quick walk down memory lane. Halo: The Master Chief Collection (“MCC”) launched for Xbox One back in 2014 and offered four complete game experiences in one handy package. Soon thereafter, Halo 3: ODST’s campaign was added, rounding out the ultimate collection of classic Halo game content. gtOver ## Street Style Patch Notes and Megathread ## Patch Notes (https://www.paladins.com/news/street-style-update-notes) • Forum Post ( • Livestream (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aZk9ZJNVp8) • Highlights (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu9z5rLlC4M) • Street Style PTS Update Notes (https://www.paladins.com/news/street-style-pts-update-notes) UPDATE 4/5/2019: Originally, the price for the Legionnaire Atlas. Hey fellow reditors, we are a group of old friends and we meet up twice a year for a long weekend of couch (offline) coop gaming and play a handful of times a month coop games online. We already did this on other platforms but are really going strong on the switch. I think you can consider us Coop-Experts. We often notice that some of the games we play are not played by anyone else (no other parties in the online lobbies, very rare occasions of randoms joining us) so I guess I would The game launched a week or two ago on the Epic Games store. It costs , and is a modified version of Roller Coaster Tycoon Touch, just without microtransactions (Roller Coaster Tycoon Touch, in turn, is a modified version of Roller Coaster Tycoon World but simpler and with better stability and optimization, because iPhones are less powerful than PCs). Paying  for a Mobile Game sounds terrible, but wait, there's more! The Epic Store is not the only place where Roller Coaster Tycoon Adventur. 
I have been for a last year methodically searching the best controller for PC gaming. I have been a keyboard and mouse player for whole my gaming "career" but in recent years I have been moderately bummed that game interfaces have been designed straight up to gamepads. Latest example of this in my opinion is The Division 2 which is really cumbersome to use with kb/m combination. All this is totally understandable because this way developers don't have to design 2 different interfaces Headline: Extra, extra good. amp#x200B; Translation of the verdict: Congratulations, Codemasters! We like Dirt Rally 2.0 very much and find it is pleasently remeniscient of the greatness of Colin McRae Rally 2 - so harmonious is the overall package and pure the rally experience. amp#x200B; With Phil Mills, the game offers one of the best co-pilots of all time. His clear English directions make a bigger difference than you might have thought. We find them even more important Not really a true review, just general impressions and feedback for the early release version of Anthem after hitting level 30, completing all of the story missions and 90% of the side missions. I am trying to refrain from giving the game a "glowing" endorsement or a "scathing" denouncement and instead want to impart my feelings on the game to help other people can decide if they want the game. This will probably parrot a lot of the things other people have spoken #Koga's Revenge ## Patch Notes (https://www.paladins.com/news/1-3-update-notes-kogas-revenge) • Forum Post ( • Livestream (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MAVmbEqS_Q) • Overview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glVJNZEQL-U) ## Flair (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYT0AQzpaNw#/flairkoga) New Champion: Koga, The Lost Hand (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYT0AQzpaNw) Lore: Once, a nameless. Hello everyone, I'm looking for replacement for my old Xbox 360 controller. From all available on market controllers I chose these two to compare: Razer Wolverine Tournament and Xbox Elite controller. I use controller only on PC, usually while playing games that demand a lot of buttons. You probably noticed this huge problem while playing newer games like: PUBG, Street Fighter V, Witcher 3 etc. These games are simply unplayable on standard 7/8 generation gamepads. Hello everyone. I'm not sure if this is an alright place to post this, but I hope it'll be ok. FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T READ THE TITLE, PLEASE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, READ THE ENTIRE POST!

So, I'm getting into some older fighting games like Third Strike and stuff, and I wanted to get a good controller. TLW is harder to use on consoles. Sure, agreed. But, I mean, if it sucks, it sucks for everybody. The playing field is even. I get the disappointment, the ADS recoil should be toned down (to D1's Perfect Balance set of perks on the D1's TLW). And honestly if Bungie wanted it to be a hipfire mostly gun, all they had to do was to change the RPM on ADS while having the recoil manageable. But I guess the current solution is fine, too, as it promotes mastery. However, imagine being a gamepad player. Hello everyone.

Hi I just got an adapter to try to play melee on dolphin but for some reason my adapter is only detected when I don't have the game launched. The moment I launch my melee the configuration shows that the adapter is no longer detected. I tried changing it to pc mode but I don't have the option of "standard controller Dinput/0/gamepad" either, so I can't even configure it. I know that the adapter works on switch because I've used it to play some ultimate with friends but nothing seems

Greetings, I originally posted this over on the EA Answers HQ forum, but it may get a little more visibility here. (Also edited the post slightly from that one since I was able to confirm a couple things in-game.) amp#x200B; After watching the most recent live stream (2/20/19), it was mentioned that one of the limitations to potentially adding more features (such as the often requested ping system from Apex Legends) was that there weren't any open buttons on the gamepad controls (Xbox Hello everyone, I'm looking for replacement for my old Xbox 360 controller.

So this is what I am trying to accomplish. I am starting an arcade build, for now I will have two seperate arcade sticks enclosures with 2 zero delay encoders and a flush mount usb port on each. I want the sticks to be player 1 and 2 primarily with the usb ports to be player 3 and 4. But I also want the usb ports to sometimes just use a plug in controller, for example n64. And revert to player 1 and 2. Can this be accomplished? Soon i will be using an iPac ultimate with full rgb buttons. What of these controllers you recommend? im searching for the best relation cost-benefit to play fps. amp#x200B; \- Xbox one controller elite (https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-one/dp/B00ZDNNRB8/ref=sr_1_3?s=videogamesampie=UTF8ampqid=1543738274ampsr=1-3ampkeywords=xbox%2Bone%2Beliteampth=1) 0 \- Razer wolverine ultimate (https://www.amazon.com/d/Pc-Gamepads-Game-Controllers/RAZER-WOLVERINE-ULTIMATE-Multi-Function-Intrchangeable-Thumbsticker/B074RNL1RX/ref=. --See bottom for a response to the common criticism "PS4 just can't run No Man's Sky VR"-- ___________ (Note that as a PS4/PSVR user I will be speaking from the perspective of such a player, but my comments are easily adapted to apply to PC VR as well).

Lately, I feel like I forgot how to play the game. My QP performance can be 8KD and then 0.8KD in the next game (and when I check the enemy team ELOs, there's nothing there that should warrant such a defeat). You all have probably noticed that no one complains about gamepads on PC anymore.
